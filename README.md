# job-description-scraping-tool

This tool aims to scrape key data from a job posting page. Key data such as Application Deadline, Job Title, Skill Requirement, and etc, if provided.

To use the tool, provide a job posting Url to the command line and the script will output a txt file.

For now, the tool only works with RBC Canada. Will include other banks later.
